In evolutionary biology, cooperation describes interactions where an individual pays a small cost to yield a larger
benefit to one or more others. If this costly contribution is reciprocated, everyone involved can benefit tremendously.
This principle also applies to proactive members of the Arch community wanting to get involved and contribute to their
favorite Linux distribution. Their participation benefits not only the community member and their fellow Archers, but
all users of free and open source software.
